## Key Findings
- **Peak Accident Times:** Most accidents occur during rush hours (7-9 AM and 5-7 PM).
- **High-Risk Locations:** Urban areas and intersections are hotspots.
- **Common Causes:** Speeding, distracted driving, and weather conditions are leading causes.
- **Demographic Impact:** Young drivers (18-25) are more frequently involved in severe accidents.

## Actions / Recommendations
- **Enforcement:** Increase speed limit enforcement and penalties for distracted driving.
- **Infrastructure:** Improve road signage and lighting at high-risk locations.
- **Education:** Launch targeted awareness campaigns for young drivers on safe driving practices.
